### Update: I've sold this project to the AI and Data Science PaaS company OnePanel Inc. who are hosting it as a commercial API here-> https://www.onepanel.io/algorithms/twitter-sentiment-analyzer.html. However, I will continue to publicly host the code for the open-source community.

Microblogging today has become a very popular communication tool among Internet users. Millions of messages are appearing daily in popular web-sites that provide services for microblogging such as Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook. Authors of those messages write about their life, share opinions on variety of topics and discuss current issues. Because of a free format of messages and an easy accessibility
of microblogging platforms, Internet users tend to shift from traditional communication tools (such as traditional blogs or mailing lists) to microblogging services. As more and more users post about products and services they use, or express their political and religious views, microblogging web-sites become valuable sources of people’s opinions and sentiments. Such data can be efficiently used
for marketing or social studies.[1]

##  1  Introduction

###  1.1 Applications of  Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment Analysis finds its application in a variety of domains.


**A. Online Commerce**

The most general use of sentiment analysis is in ecommerce
activities. Websites allows their users to
submit their experience about shopping and product
qualities. They provide summary for the product and
different features of the product by assigning ratings or
scores. Customers can easily view opinions and
recommendation information on whole product as well
as specific product features. Graphical summary of the
overall product and its features is presented to users.
Popular merchant websites like amazon.com provides
review from editors and also from customers with
rating information. http://tripadvisor.in is a popular
website that provides reviews on hotels, travel
destinations. They contain 75 millions opinions and
reviews worldwide. Sentiment analysis helps such
websites by converting dissatisfied customers into
promoters by analyzing this huge volume of opinions.


**B. Voice of the Market (VOM)**

Voice of the Market is about determining what
customers are feeling about products or services of
competitors. Accurate and timely information from the
Voice of the Market helps in gaining competitive
advantage and new product development. Detection of
such information as early as possible helps in direct and
target key marketing campaigns. Sentiment Analysis
helps corporate to get customer opinion in real-time.
This real-time information helps them to design new
marketing strategies, improve product features and can
predict chances of product failure.
Zhang et al.proposed weakness finder system
which can help manufacturers find their product
weakness from Chinese reviews by using aspects based
sentiment analysis. There are some commercial and
free sentiment analysis services are available, Radiant6,
Sysomos, Viralheat, Lexalytics, etc. are commercial
services. Some free tools like www.tweettfeel.com,
www.socialmention.com are also available.


**C. Voice of the Customer (VOC)**

Voice of the Customer is concern about what
individual customer is saying about products or
services. It means analyzing the reviews and feedback
of the customers. VOC is a key element of Customer
Experience Management. VOC helps in identifying
new opportunities for product inventions. Extracting
customer opinions also helps identify functional
requirements of the products and some non-functional
requirements like performance and cost.


**D. Brand Reputation Management**

Brand Reputation Management is concern about
managing your reputation in market. Opinions from
customers or any other parties can damage or enhance
your reputation. Brand Reputation Management (BRM)
is a product and company focused rather than customer.
Now, one-to-many conversations are taking place
online at a high rate. That creates opportunities for
organizations to manage and strengthen brand
reputation. Now Brand perception is determined not
only by advertising, public relations and corporate
messaging. Brands are now a sum of the conversations
about them. Sentiment analysis helps in determining
how company’s brand, product or service is being
perceived by community online.


**E. Government**

Sentiment analysis helps government in assessing
their strength and weaknesses by analyzing opinions
from public. For example, “If this is the state, how do
you expect truth to come out? The MP who is
investigating 2g scam himself is deeply corrupt.”.
this example clearly shows negative sentiment about
government.
Whether it is tracking citizens’ opinions on a new
108 system, identifying strengths and weaknesses in a
recruitment campaign in government job, assessing
success of electronic submission of tax returns, or
many other areas, we can see the potential for
sentiment analysis.

### 1.2 Characteristic features of Tweets 

From the perspective of Sentiment
Analysis, we discuss a few characteristics of Twitter:

**Length of a Tweet**
     The maximum length of a Twitter message is 140 characters. This means that we can practically consider a tweet to be a single sentence, void of complex grammatical constructs. This is a vast difference from traditional subjects of Sentiment Analysis, such as movie reviews. 
     
**Language used**
     Twitter is used via a variety of media including SMS and mobile phone apps. Because of this and the 140-character limit, language used in Tweets tend be more colloquial, and filled with slang and misspellings. Use of hashtags also gained popularity on Twitter and is a primary feature in any given tweet. Our analysis shows that there are approximately 1-2 hashtags per tweet, as shown in Table 3 . 
     
**Data availability**
     Another difference is the magnitude of data available. With the Twitter API, it is easy to collect millions of tweets for training. There also exist a few datasets that have automatically and manually labelled the tweets [2] [3]. 
     
**Domain of topics**
     People often post about their likes and dislikes on social media. These are not al concentrated around one topic. This makes twitter a unique place to model a generic classifier as opposed to domain specific classifiers that could be build datasets such as movie reviews. 
     
     
## 2  Related Work

### 2.1 [Go, Bhayani and Huang (2009)](http://www-cs.stanford.edu/people/alecmgo/papers/TwitterDistantSupervision09.pdf)

 They classify Tweets for a query term into negative or positive sentiment. They collect training dataset automatically from Twitter. To collect positive and negative tweets, they query twitter for happy and sad emoticons.
 
 * Happy emoticons are different versions of smiling face, like ":)", ":-)", ": )", ":D", "=)" etc.
 * Sad emoticons include frowns, like ":(", ":-(", ":(" etc.
 
They try various features – unigrams, bigrams and Part-of-Speech and train their classifier on various machine learning algorithms – Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and Scalable Vector Machines and compare it against a baseline classifier by counting the number of positive and negative words from a publicly available corpus. They report that Bigrams alone and Part-of-Speech Tagging are not helpful and that Naive Bayes Classifier gives the best results.

### 2.2 [Pak and Paroubek (2010)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad8a/7f620a57478ff70045f97abc7aec9687ccbd.pdf)

They identify that use of informal and creative language make sentiment analysis of tweets a rather different task . They leverage previous work done in hashtags and sentiment analysis to build their classifier. They use Edinburgh Twitter corpus to find out most frequent hashtags. They manually classify these hashtags and use them to in turn classify the tweets. Apart from using n-grams and Part-of-Speech features, they also build a feature set from already existing MPQA subjectivity lexicon and Internet Lingo Dictionary. They report that the best results are seen with n-gram features with lexicon features, while using Part-of-Speech features causes a drop in accuracy.

### 2.3 [Koulompis, Wilson and Moore (2011)](http://www.aclweb.org/website/old_anthology/S/S13/S13-2.pdf#page=526)

They investigated the utility of linguistic features for detecting the sentiment of Twitter messages. They evaluated
the usefulness of existing lexical resources as well as features that capture information about the informal and creative language
used in microblogging. They took a supervised approach to the problem, but leverage existing hashtags in the Twitter
data for building training data.

### 2.3 [Saif, He and Alani (2012)](http://oro.open.ac.uk/34929/1/76490497.pdf)

They discuss a semantic based approach to identify the entity being discussed in a tweet, like a person, organization etc. They also demonstrate that removal of stop words is not a necessary step and may have undesirable effect on the classifier.


All of the aforementioned techniques rely on n-gram features. It is unclear that the use of Part-of-Speech tagging is useful or not. To improve accuracy, some employ different methods of feature selection or leveraging knowledge about micro-blogging. In contrast, we improve our results by using more basic techniques used in Sentiment Analysis, like stemming, two-step classification and negation detection and scope of negation.

Negation detection is a technique that has often been studied in sentiment analysis. Negation words like “not”, “never”, “no” etc. can drastically change the meaning of a sentence and hence the sentiment expressed in them. Due to presence of such words, the meaning of nearby words becomes opposite. Such words are said to be in the scope of negation. Many researches have worked on detecting the scope of negation.

The scope of negation of a cue can be taken from that word to the next following punctuation. Councill, McDonald and Velikovich (2010) discuss a technique to identify negation cues and their scope in a sentence. They identify explicit negation cues in the text and for each word in the scope. Then they find its distance from the nearest negative cue on the left and right.

##  3  Approach

We use different feature sets and machine learning classifiers to determine
the best combination for sentiment analysis of twitter. We also experiment
with various pre-processing steps like - punctuations, emoticons, twitter
specific terms and stemming. We investigated the following features -
unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and negation detection. We finally train our
classifier using various machine-learning algorithms - Naive Bayes, Decision
Trees and Maximum Entropy.

![Ayush's Approach](http://i.imgur.com/mXBzrNU.png)

Figure 1: Schematic Block Representation of the Methodology

We use a modularized approach with feature extractor and classification
algorithm as two independent components. This enables us to experiment with
different options for each component.

###  3.1  Datasets

One of the major challenges in Sentiment Analysis of Twitter is to collect a
labelled dataset. Researchers have made public the following datasets for
training and testing classifiers.

####  3.1.1  Twitter Sentiment Corpus

This is a collection of 5513 tweets collected for four different topics,
namely, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Twitter It is collected and hand-classified
by Sanders Analytics LLC. Each entry in the corpus contains, Tweet id,
Topic and a Sentiment label. We use Twitter-Python library to enrich this data
by downloading data like Tweet text, Creation Date, Creator etc. for every
Tweet id. Each Tweet is hand classified by an American male into the following
four categories. For the purpose of our experiments, we consider Irrelevant
and Neutral to be the same class. Illustration of Tweets in this corpus is
show in Table 1 .

- **Positive**
     For showing positive sentiment towards the topic
     
- **Positive**
     For showing no or mixed or weak sentiments towards the topic
     
- **Negative**
     For showing negative sentiment towards the topic
     
- **Irrelevant**
     For non English text or off-topic comments

####  3.1.2  Stanford Twitter

This corpus of tweets, developed by Sanford’s Natural Language processing
research group, is publically available. The training set is collected by
querying Twitter API for happy emoticons like "`:)`" and sad emoticons like
"`:(`" and labelling them positive or negative. The emoticons were then
stripped and Re-Tweets and duplicates removed. It also contains around 500
tweets manually collected and labelled for testing purposes. We randomly
sample and use 5000 tweets from this dataset. An example of Tweets in this
corpus are shown in Table 2 .

<div style="text-align:center">

###  3.2  Pre Processing

User-generated content on the web is seldom present in a form usable for
learning. It becomes important to normalize the text by applying a series of
pre-processing steps. We have applied an extensive set of pre-processing steps
to decrease the size of the feature set to make it suitable for learning
algorithms. Figure 2 illustrates various features seen in micro-blogging.
Table 3 illustrates the frequency of these features per tweet, cut by
datasets. We also give a brief description of pre-processing steps taken.

<div style="text-align:center">Table 3: Frequency of Features per Tweet</div>
<a id="tab:feat_freq">

</div>

####  3.2.1  Hashtags

A hashtag is a word or an un-spaced phrase prefixed with the hash symbol (#).
These are used to both naming subjects and phrases that are currently in
trending topics. For example, #iPad, #news

Regular Expression: `#(\w+)`

Replace Expression: `HASH_\1`

####  3.2.2  Handles

Every Twitter user has a unique username. Any thing directed towards that user
can be indicated be writing their username preceded by ‘@’. Thus, these are
like proper nouns. For example, @Apple

Regular Expression: `@(\w+)`

Replace Expression: `HNDL_\1`

####  3.2.3  URLs

Users often share hyperlinks in their tweets. Twitter shortens them using its
in-house URL shortening service, like http://t.co/FCWXoUd8 - such links also
enables Twitter to alert users if the link leads out of its domain. From the
point of view of text classification, a particular URL is not important.
However, presence of a URL can be an important feature. Regular expression for
detecting a URL is fairly complex because of different types of URLs that can
be there, but because of Twitter’s shortening service, we can use a relatively
simple regular expression.

Regular Expression: `(http|https|ftp)://[a-zA-Z0-9\\./]+`

Replace Expression: `URL`

####  3.2.4  Emoticons

Use of emoticons is very prevalent throughout the web, more so on micro-
blogging sites. We identify the following emoticons and replace them with a
single word. Table 4 lists the emoticons we are currently detecting. All other
emoticons would be ignored.

<div style="text-align:center"> 
<table border="1">
<tr><td colspan="1" align="center">Emoticons </td><td colspan="6" align="center">Examples </td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><tt>EMOT_SMILEY</tt>   </td><td align="left"><tt>:-)</tt>  </td><td align="left"><tt>:)</tt>   </td><td align="left"><tt>(:</tt>   </td><td align="left"><tt>(-:</tt>  </td><td align="left"><tt></tt>     </td><td align="left"><tt></tt> </td></tr>

</a>
</div>

####  3.2.5  Punctuations

Although not all Punctuations are important from the point of view of
classification but some of these, like question mark, exclamation mark can
also provide information about the sentiments of the text. We replace every
word boundary by a list of relevant punctuations present at that point. Table
5 lists the punctuations currently identified. We also remove any single
quotes that might exist in the text.

<div style="text-align:center"> 
<table border="1">
<tr><td colspan="1" align="center">Punctuations </td><td colspan="2" align="center">Examples </td></tr>
<tr><td align="left"><tt>PUNC_DOT</tt> </td><td align="left"><tt>.</tt> </td><td align="left"><tt></tt> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="left"><tt>PUNC_ELLP</tt> </td><td align="left"><tt>...</tt> </td><td align="left"><tt>…</tt> </td></tr></table>


<div style="text-align:center">Table 5: List of Punctuations</div>
<a id="tab:punc">
</a>
</div>

####  3.2.6  Repeating Characters

People often use repeating characters while using colloquial language, like
"I’m in a hurrryyyyy", "We won, yaaayyyyy!" As our final pre-processing step,
we replace characters repeating more than twice as two characters.

Regular Expression: `(.)\1{1,}`

Replace Expression: `\1\1`

#### Reduction in feature space

It’s important to note that by applying these pre-processing steps, we are
reducing our feature set otherwise it can be too sparse. Table 6 lists the
decrease in feature set due to processing each of these features.

###  3.3  Stemming Algorithms

All stemming algorithms are of the following major types – affix removing,
statistical and mixed. The first kind, Affix removal stemmer, is the most
basic one. These apply a set of transformation rules to each word in an
attempt to cut off commonly known prefixes and / or suffixes [8]. A trivial
stemming algorithm would be to truncate words at N-th symbol. But this
obviously is not well suited for practical purposes.

J.B. Lovins described first stemming algorithm in 1968. It defines 294
endings, each linked to one of 29 conditions, plus 35 transformation rules.
For a word being stemmed, an ending with a satisfying condition is found and
removed. Another famous stemmer used extensively is described in the next
section.

####  3.3.1  Porter Stemmer

Martin Porter wrote a stemmer that was published in July 1980. This stemmer
was very widely used and became and remains the de facto standard algorithm
used for English stemming. It offers excellent trade-off between speed,
readability, and accuracy. It uses a set of around 60 rules applied in 6
successive steps [9]. An important feature to note is that it doesn’t involve
recursion. The steps in the algorithm are described in Table 7 .

<div style="text-align:center">
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="right">1.    </td><td align="left">Gets rid of plurals and -ed or -ing suffixes </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">2.    </td><td align="left">Turns terminal y to i when there is another vowel in the stem￼ </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">3.    </td><td align="left">Maps double suffixes to single ones: -ization, -ational, etc. </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">4.    </td><td align="left">Deals with suffixes, -full, -ness etc. </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">5.￼   </td><td align="left">Takes off -ant, -ence, etc. </td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">6.    </td><td align="left">Removes a final –e </td></tr></table>

####  3.3.2  Lemmatization

Lemmatization is the process of normalizing a word rather than just finding
its stem. In the process, a suffix may not only be removed, but may also be
substituted with a different one. It may also involve first determining the
part-of-speech for a word and then applying normalization rules. It might also
involve dictionary look-up. For example, verb ‘saw’ would be lemmatized to
‘see’ and the noun ‘saw’ will remain ‘saw’. For our purpose of classifying
text, stemming should suffice.

###  3.4  Features

A wide variety of features can be used to build a classifier for tweets. The
most widely used and basic feature set is word n-grams. However, there's a lot
of domain specific information present in tweets that can also be used for
classifying them. We have experimented with two sets of features:

####  3.4.1  Unigrams

Unigrams are the simplest features that can be used for text classification. A
Tweet can be represented by a multiset of words present in it. We, however,
have used the presence of unigrams in a tweet as a feature set. Presence of a
word is more important than how many times it is repeated. Pang et al. found
that presence of unigrams yields better results than repetition [1]. This also
helps us to avoid having to scale the data, which can considerably decrease
training time [2]. Figure 3 illustrated the cumulative distribution of words
in our dataset.

Figure 3: Cumulative Frequency Plot for 50 Most Frequent Unigrams

We also observe that the unigrams nicely follow Zipf’s law. It states that in
a corpus of natural language, the frequency of any word is inversely
proportional to its rank in the frequency table. Figure 4 is a plot of log
frequency versus log rank of our dataset. A linear trendline fits well with
the data.

####  3.4.2  N-grams

N-gram refers to an n-long sequence of words. Probabilistic Language Models
based on Unigrams, Bigrams and Trigrams can be successfully used to predict
the next word given a current context of words. In the domain of sentiment
analysis, the performance of N-grams is unclear. According to Pang et al.,
some researchers report that unigrams alone are better than bigrams for
classification movie reviews, while some others report that bigrams and
trigrams yield better product-review polarity classification [1].

As the order of the n-grams increases, they tend to be more and more sparse.
Based on our experiments, we find that number of bigrams and trigrams increase
much more rapidly than the number of unigrams with the number of Tweets.
Figure 4 shows the number of n-grams versus number of Tweets. We can observe
that bigrams and trigrams increase almost linearly where as unigrams are
increasing logarithmically.

Figure 4: Number of n-grams vs. Number of Tweets

Because higher order n-grams are sparsely populated, we decide to trim off the
n-grams that are not seen more than once in the training corpus, because
chances are that these n-grams are not good indicators of sentiments. After
the filtering out non-repeating n-grams, we see that the number of n-grams is
considerably decreased and equals the order of unigrams, as shown in Figure 5
.

####  3.4.3  Negation Handling

The need negation detection in sentiment analysis can be illustrated by the
difference in the meaning of the phrases, "This is good" vs. "This is not
good" However, the negations occurring in natural language are seldom so
simple. Handling the negation consists of two tasks – Detection of explicit
negation cues and the scope of negation of these words.

Councill et al. look at whether negation detection is useful for sentiment
analysis and also to what extent is it possible to determine the exact scope
of a negation in the text [7]. They describe a method for negation detection
based on Left and Right Distances of a token to the nearest explicit negation
cue.

#### Detection of Explicit Negation Cues

To detect explicit negation cues, we are looking for the following words in
Table 8 . The search is done using regular expressions.

<div style="text-align:center">
<table border="1">
<tr><td align="left">S.No. </td><td align="left">Negation Cues </td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">1.  </td><td align="left">never </td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">2.  </td><td align="left">no </td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">3.  </td><td align="left">nothing </td></tr>

</div>

#### Scope of Negation

Words immediately preceding and following the negation cues are the most
negative and the words that come farther away do not lie in the scope of
negation of such cues. We define left and right negativity of a word as the
chances that meaning of that word is actually the opposite. Left negativity
depends on the closest negation cue on the left and similarly for Right
negativity. Figure 7 illustrates the left and right negativity of words in a
tweet.

##  4  Experimentation

We train 90% of our data using different combinations of features and test
them on the remaining 10%. We take the features in the following combinations
- only unigrams, unigrams + filtered bigrams and trigrams, unigrams +
negation, unigrams + filtered bigrams and trigrams + negation. We then train
classifiers using different classification algorithms - Naive Bayes Classifier
and Maximum Entropy Classifier.

The task of classification of a tweet can be done in two steps - first,
classifying "neutral" (or "subjective") vs. "objective" tweets and second,
classifying objective tweets into "positive" vs. "negative" tweets. We also
trained 2 step classifiers. The accuracies for each of these configuration are
shown in Figure 8 , we discuss these in detail below.

![Figure](http://i.imgur.com/TfYr9Se.png)

Figure 8: Accuracy for Naive Bayes Classifier

###  4.1  Naive Bayes

Naive Bayes classifier is the simplest and the fastest classifier. Many
researchers [2], [4] claim to have gotten best results using this classifier.

For a given tweet, if we need to find the label for it, we find the
probabilities of all the labels, given that feature and then select the label
with maximum probability.

The results from training the Naive Bayes classifier are shown below in Figure
8 . The accuracy of Unigrams is the lowest at 79.67%. The accuracy increases
if we also use Negation detection (81.66%) or higher order n-grams (86.68%).
We see that if we use both Negation detection and higher order n-grams, the
accuracy is marginally less than just using higher order n-grams (85.92%). We
can also note that accuracies for double step classifier are lesser than those
for corresponding single step.

We have also shown Precision versus Recall values for Naive Bayes classifier
corresponding to different classes – Negative, Neutral and Positive in Figure
9 . The solid markers show the P-R values for single step classifier and
hollow markers show the affect of using double step classifier. Different
points are for different feature sets. We can see that both precision as well
as recall values are higher for single step than that for double step.

Figure 9: Precision vs. Recall for Naive Bayes Classifier

###  4.2  Maximum Entropy Classifier

This classifier works by finding a probability distribution that maximizes the
likelihood of testable data. This probability function is parameterized by
weight vector. The optimal value of which can be found out using the method of
Lagrange multipliers.

  
The results from training the Maximum Entropy Classifier are shown below in Figure
10 . Accuracies follow a similar trend as compared to Naive Bayes classifier.
Unigram is the lowest at 79.73% and we see an increase for negation detection
at 80.96%. The maximum is achieved with unigrams, bigrams and trigrams at
85.22% closely followed by n-grams and negation at 85.16%. Once again, the
accuracies for double step classifiers are considerably lower.

Precision versus Recall map is also shown for maximum entropy classifier in
Figure 10 . Here we see that precision of "neutral" class increase by using a
double step classifier, but with a considerable decrease in its recall and
slight fall in precision of "negative" and "positive" classes.

##  5  Future Work

**Investigating Support Vector Machines**
     Several papers have discussed the results using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) also. The next step would be to test our approach on SVMs. However, Go, Bhayani and Huang have reported that SVMs do not increase the accuracy [2]. 
     
**Building a classifier for Hindi tweets**
     There are many users on Twitter that use primarily Hindi language. The approach discussed here can be used to create a Hindi language sentiment classifier. 
     
**Improving Results using Semantics Analysis**
     Understanding the role of the nouns being talked about can help us better classify a given tweet. For example, "Skype often crashing: microsoft, what are you doing?" Here Skype is a product and Microsoft is a company. We can use semantic labellers to achieve this. Such an approach is discussed by Saif, He and Alani [6]. 

##  6  Conclusion

We create a sentiment classifier for twitter using labelled
data sets. We also investigate the relevance of using a double step classifier
and negation detection for the purpose of sentiment analysis.

Our baseline classifier that uses just the unigrams achieves an accuracy of
around 80.00%. Accuracy of the classifier increases if we use negation
detection or introduce bigrams and trigrams. Thus we can conclude that both
Negation Detection and higher order n-grams are useful for the purpose of text
classification. However, if we use both n-grams and negation detection, the
accuracy falls marginally. We also note that Single step classifiers out
perform double step classifiers. In general, Naive Bayes Classifier performs
better than Maximum Entropy Classifier.

We achieve the best accuracy of 86.68% in the case of Unigrams + Bigrams +
Trigrams, trained on Naive Bayes Classifier.
