No Allignment test
------------------

    >>> from nltk.translate import meteor

If the candidate has no alignment to any of the references, the METEOR score is 0.

    >>> round(meteor(
    ...     ['The candidate has no alignment to any of the references'],
    ...     'John loves Mary'
    ... ),4)
    0.0

Tests based on wikipedia examples

Testing on `wikipedia examples <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METEOR#Examples>`_

    >>> same_res = round(meteor(
    ...       ['The cat sat on the mat'], 
    ...       'The cat sat on the mat'
    ...       ),4)
    >>> abs(same_res - 0.9977) < 1e-2
    True

    >>> meteor(
    ...       ['The cat sat on the mat'], 
    ...       'on the mat sat the cat'
    ...       )
    0.5

    >>> round(meteor(
    ...       ['The cat sat on the mat'], 
    ...       'The cat was sat on the mat'
    ...       ),4)
